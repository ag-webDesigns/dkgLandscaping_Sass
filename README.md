# dkgLandscaping_Sass

## Description

This project is a sample landing page for a fictional landscaping company. It's also an homage to my mother's passion for gardening! I built this to practice CSS an Sass skills I learned from Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course, [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/).

### CSS and Sass practice

- 7 - 1 Folder pattern (even though 'themes' and 'vendors' are not in use)
- BEM naming convention
- Sass mixins
- Sass variables
- Keyframes animation
- Legacy grid technique (using 'float' property and 'clearfix' technique)
